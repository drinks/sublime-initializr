# Initializr

Quickly bootstrap and open an HTML5 Boilerplate project from Sublime.

## Installation

**Package Control**

Add https://github.com/drinks/sublime-initializr to your Package Control repositories and install.

**Vanilla Sublime**

Clone this repo into your Packages folder.

## Usage

Just run the command:

```
Initializr: New Project
```

Provide a path for your new project and hit enter. That's it!

**Note:**  
If you're using Sublime Text 2, there's no way to set the current project programmatically, so you'll have to select the new .sublime-project file from the dialog that appears.

## Settings

- `zip_url`: The url to a customized build from <http://initializr.com> with the skeleton you want to boostrap

- `default_path`: The location that will be pre-filled in the dialog box on creation
